# Contributing

Pull requests are great! If you want to add a feature, fix a bug, or just improve Nebulet in some way, submit your changes as a pull request to the correct repository.

Before submitting, make sure that it works locally on your machine.

At that point, you're waiting on us. We'll try to at least comment within one business day. Be prepared to make changes or defend your decisions :)

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Comment code that isn't explicit
* Keep performance in mind
* Write a [good commit message][commit]
